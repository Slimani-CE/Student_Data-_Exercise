Student Data Exercise
This repository contains a Python script with a set of data and questions related to a group of students. The data includes the students' names, genders, groups, and scores on two exams (DS and TP). It also includes attendance data for each student for four seances (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday).

The questions ask for information about the students such as the names of students in a particular group, the number of each gender in each group, the names of absent students for a particular seance, and the mean exam scores for each group.

To use the script, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. Then, clone or download the repository and navigate to the directory in a terminal. Run the script with the following command:

Copy code
python student_data.py
The script will output the answers to the questions. You can modify the script to answer different questions or to use the data in other ways.

I hope you find this exercise helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
